Alarms api
----------

Your containers will automatically generate alarms on critical conditions, those alarms, in addition to being showed via jabber or console, are stored in a database to be easily retrieved via the api.

The amount of alarms to be stored is limited by default to 100 per container (but you can ask your supplier to increase them).

To access the list of stored alarms you call /alarms/:

```
curl https://kratos:deimos@foobar.com/api/alarms/
```

Alarms fields
-------------

Each alarm entry exposes the following fields/attributes:

* id (the unique identifier of the alarm)
* container (the uid of the container generating the alarm, required)
* level (identify the type of the alarm, there is a pre-defined list of levels, see below)
* color (a user-defined color in the form #rrggbb, can be used by api GUI)
* class (a user-defined class for the alarm)
* vassal (a user-defined value for the vassal generating the alarm)
* line (the line of code generating the error, useful for storing exceptions)
* filename (the filename generating the error, useful for storing exceptions)
* func (the function generating the error, useful for storing exceptions)
* unix (the unix time of the alarm, required)
* msg (the body of the alarm, required)


Alarms levels
-------------

Currently the following 'levels' are defined. They are conventions (they are effectively simple positive numbers), that can be used in GUIs:

* system (value 0, this is set by default for exceptions generated by the system, like out of quota and out of memory)
