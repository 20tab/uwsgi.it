Managing custom distributions
=============================

Starting from june 2015 you can use your personal distributions in addition
the the ones supplied by the platform (and shared by all customers).

Obviously when you use your own distros your uwsgi.it supplier could have difficulties
on support, so take in account that very probably if you choose to use a custom distro you are on your own.

Another important topic is that your images must be constantly security checked (while platforms distros are checked by your uwsgi.it supplier). Do not forget to do it ! Using a custom distro could basically means you need to came back to doing lot of boring sysadmin tasks.
